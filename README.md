# Superstore---Triple-ten-Project-5
This project analyzes product return trends for a fictional Superstore. Using Tableau, I explored return rates, geographic patterns, and product-level data to help uncover the root causes behind high product returns. The goal: help the company improve product quality, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.
